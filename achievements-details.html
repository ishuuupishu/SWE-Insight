                    <p>When the Software Engineering department at Metropolitan University embarked on their new journey in 2022, they were joined by 35-40 exceptional students from various colleges across the Sylhet district. These talented individuals, brimming with enthusiasm and team spirit, quickly made a name for themselves and their department.
                        The pioneering cricket team, SWE Dynamites, made history by participating in the first MPL (Metropolitan University Premier League) cricket tournament held on their own campus in January 2022. In their debut, they represented their department with pride and reached the quarter-finals, leaving a lasting impression.
                        Their versatility and determination shone through as they also competed in the Futsal tournament the same year, advancing to the semi-finals. The team's impressive streak continued in League-M, where they again reached the quarter-finals, establishing themselves as formidable contenders in various competitions.
                        In 2023, SWE Dynamites participated in the MPL once more, this time making it to the semi-finals, a testament to their growing strength and dedication. They also advanced to the semi-finals in the League-M tournament that year, further solidifying their reputation.
                        Demonstrating their commitment and progress, the SWE department entered the 2024 MPL with two teams, showcasing their depth and talent. From the very beginning, these students have upheld and enhanced the department's reputation, introducing the Software Engineering department's name with pride and distinction through their remarkable performances in football, cricket, and more.</p>
